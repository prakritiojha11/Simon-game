 **"Get ready to challenge your memory skills and have some fun with Simon - the classic electronic game brought to life in your browser! Follow the patterns and climb the levels to become the ultimate Simon master. Are you up for the challenge?"**

**The Simon Game is a simple memory game, in which the user needs to repeat the sequence of colors and sounds generated by the computer. The game gets progressively harder as the user successfully completes each level.
This project is a web-based version of the Simon Game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

# :woman_shrugging: **How to Play**
*To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Press any key to start the game. The computer will randomly generate a sequence of colors and sounds. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order. Each time you successfully complete a level, the game will get harder by adding an additional color to the sequence. If you make a mistake, the game will end and you'll have to start over*

# **Files**
**The project consists of the following files:**<br>
**1) index.html: The main HTML file, which contains the game board and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.<br>
  2) styles.css: The CSS file, which contains the styling for the game board and buttons.<br>
  3) game.js: The JavaScript file, which contains the game logic and functionality.**

# **Game Logic**
*The game logic is contained within the game.js file. The game uses two arrays to keep track of the sequence of colors and the user's clicked colors. Each time the user clicks on a color button, the clicked color is added to the user's array, and the function checkAnswer is called to check if the user's sequence matches the computer's sequence. If the user's sequence matches, the game moves on to the next level. If the user makes a mistake, the game ends and the startOver function is called to reset the game.*
